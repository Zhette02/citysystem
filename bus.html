        Language barriers are something I think about alot. On this bus ride
        there were 4 different languages being spoken all at once. Having some
        experience navigating public transportation systems that are not in my
        native language, I know it can be a challenge. I wonder how people do it
        in NYC. This seems like one of the strangest systems that I have
        encountered. NYCs public transit system feels like its falling apart at
        all times. Like its alive and the MTA are caretakers. During my first
        year living here I got lost constantly. I still dont know how we all get
        where we need to go.
