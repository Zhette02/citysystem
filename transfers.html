        Related to the payment options are transfers. Transfers are free if you
        have a metrocard but cost the same as a regular fare with OMNY. I have a
        lot of issues with how the MTA raises fares frequently, and how
        financially inaccessible the public transit system has become.
        Especially on the Q44 bus line a transfer is impossible to avoid if you
        are traveling to Brooklyn.
